# AIClube_2048
Machine Learning Project for AI Club

Inside the java class Graphics Fun, there are two java files related to a work in progress 2048 and a legit version of the game. 

Plans to implement AI, 
  1. Create separate branches instead of commiting everything to the master branch. 
  2. Create a static AI to figure out core mechanics of the game.
  3. Machine learning stuff last.
